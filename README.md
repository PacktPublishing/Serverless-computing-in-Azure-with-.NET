# Serverless computing in Azure with .NET
This is the code repository for [Serverless computing in Azure with .NET](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/designing-azure-solutions?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786468659), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Serverless architecture allows you to build and run applications and services without having to manage the infrastructure. Many companies have started adopting serverless architecture for their applications to save cost and improve scalability.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Chapters 1 and 13 does not contain any code file.

The code will look like the following:
```
using System;
        public static void Run(TimerInfo myTimer, TraceWriter log)
        {
        try
        {
          // Throw a handled exception
          throw new Exception("This is a handled exception",
            new Exception("This is an inner exception"));
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
          log.Error($"Caught an exception: {ex.ToString()}");
        }
        }
```

This book requires the following two things:

Access to a Microsoft Azure subscription (a trial account is sufficient)
Visual Studio 2017 IDE (any edition)
